    "paragraph1": "I began to explore performance art as a safe space to express my feelings & ideas about post-postmodern life. For a long time I kept everything inside, until I discovered this powerful way of communicating; without words, using only my body as a tool for interdisciplinary dialogue, not as an escape from reality, but as a profound way of expressing what is going on inside and outside of me.",
    "paragraph2": "It allows me to connect with others in deep silence, to shout without using my voice, and to immerse myself in a laboratory where I can discover my own questions and invite others to find theirs.",
