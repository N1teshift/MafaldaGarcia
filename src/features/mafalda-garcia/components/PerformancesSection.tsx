            Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with diverse artists, institutions, and communities across different countries and cultural contexts. These collaborations have enriched my practice and expanded my understanding of performance as a universal language.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work has been presented at international festivals, galleries, and unconventional spaces, including street theater festivals, contemporary art venues, and community centers. Each performance is a unique encounter between the artist, the space, and the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notable collaborations include partnerships with Sofia Lacerda (multidisciplinary artist and finalist of the Prémio Sonae Media Arte 2022), Rui Alemão (sound artist), and various collectives focused on feminist art and social engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            My performances have been featured at events such as the XXII INTERNATIONAL STREET THEATRE FESTIVAL "ŠERMUKŠNIS" in Klaipeda, Lithuania, and various contemporary art exhibitions showcasing women artists and experimental performance practices.
