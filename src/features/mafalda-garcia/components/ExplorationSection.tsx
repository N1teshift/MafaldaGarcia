            I began to explore performance art as a safe space to express my feelings & ideas about post-postmodern life. For a long time I kept everything inside, until I discovered this powerful way of communicating; without words, using only my body as a tool for interdisciplinary dialogue, not as an escape from reality, but as a profound way of expressing what is going on inside and outside of me.

            It allows me to connect with others in deep silence, to shout without using my voice, and to immerse myself in a laboratory where I can discover my own questions and invite others to find theirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in performance art has been shaped by continuous exploration of the body as a medium for expression, communication, and transformation. Through various training programs, workshops, and collaborations, I have developed a unique approach that combines physical theater, contemporary dance, and conceptual art.

          <p>
            My education and training have focused on understanding the body as a political and social instrument, exploring how movement and stillness can convey complex narratives about identity, belonging, and human connection in our contemporary world.
