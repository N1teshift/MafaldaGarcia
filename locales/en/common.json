    "paragraph1": "I began to explore performance art as a safe space to express my feelings & ideas about post-postmodern life. For a long time I kept everything inside, until I discovered this powerful way of communicating; without words, using only my body as a tool for interdisciplinary dialogue, not as an escape from reality, but as a profound way of expressing what is going on inside and outside of me.",
    "paragraph2": "It allows me to connect with others in deep silence, to shout without using my voice, and to immerse myself in a laboratory where I can discover my own questions and invite others to find theirs.",

      "description": "Designed as a playful version of a government office, the installation featured an improvised office setting where Mafalda Garcia engaged nearly 100 visitors in a unique experience. Participants could choose from four languages - Latvian, Latgalian, English and Russian - to answer thought-provoking questions. These questions, which were philosophical in nature, included multiple-choice, open-ended and visual answers.\n\nThe idea was to invite visitors into a moment of introspection, encouraging them to think about the present moment, their origins, their direction, and fundamental concepts such as identity and morality. Simple questions led to complex answers, making the installation a social experiment that encouraged connection and meaningful dialogue.",

It is a translation of the events that took place in 1923 into the language of street theatre, conveyed without words. The inspiration behind it stems from the story of Lithuanian soldiers disguising themselves as locals and attempting to conquer the Klaipeda region.",
      "description": "The creative team of the show has reimagined the concepts of \"intrusion, invasion, coup,\" which typically carry negative connotations. They sought to transform these notions into something positive. Thus, the idea to \"conquer\" the Klaipeda region was born, not through the use of weapons, but through the power of songs.",

      "description": "A key moment of the performance was the liberation from the net, where the boundaries between body, paint, and soil dissolved. The merging of materials symbolized the dissolution of ego and character, a return to a primal state of unity with nature. Rather than resisting the unknown, the performance invited the audience to embrace their own 'swampy paths'—not with fear, but with the courage to see them as an essential part of existence.",
